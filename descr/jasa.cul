	# Regular expression to match URLs that the plugin is
	# *potentially* interested in. Any URL matching this regexp
	# will cause your parser to be invoked. Currently, this will
	# require fork()ing a process, so you should try to reduce the number
	# of false positives by making your regexp as restrictive as possible.
	#
	# If it is not possible to determine whether or not your plugin is
	# interested purely on the basis of the URL, you will have a chance
	# to refine this decision in your code. For now, try to make a reasonable
	# approximation - like, check for URLs on the right hostname
	#
	# Note: Some universities provide mirrors of commericial publishers' sites
	# with different hostnames, so you should provide some leeway in your
	# regexp if that applies to you.

# TESTS
#

# Each plugin MUST provide a set of tests. The motivation behind this is
# that web scraping code is inherently fragile, and is likely to break whenever
# the provider decides to redisign their site. CiteULike will periodically
# run tests to see if anything has broken.

# Please provide as comprehensive a set of tests as possible.
# If you ever fix a bug in the parser, it is highly recommended that
# you add the offending page as a test case.

# this one (now) redirects to an APS page

	title {Rupture of anterior cruciate ligament monitored by acoustic emission}
	abstract {The scope of this study is to relate the acoustic emission (AE) during rupture of human soft tissue (anterior cruciate ligament, ACL) to the mechanisms leading to its failure. The cumulative AE activity highlights the onset of serious damage, while other parameters, show repeatable tendencies, being well correlated with the tissueâ€™s mechanical behavior. The frequency content of AE signals increases throughout the experiment, while other indices characterize between different modes of failure. Results of this preliminary study show that AE can shed light into the failure process of this tissue, and provide useful data on the ACL reconstruction.}
